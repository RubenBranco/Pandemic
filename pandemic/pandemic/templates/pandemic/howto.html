            The goal of Pandemic is for the players, in their randomly selected roles, to work cooperatively to stop the spread of four diseases and cure them before a pandemic occurs. Pandemic setup consists of a game board representing a network connecting 48 cities on the map of the earth, two decks of cards (Player cards and Infection cards), four colors of cubes (each representing a different disease), six Research Stations, and a pawn for each player. The Player cards include cards with each city name (the same as those on the board); Special Event cards, which can be played at specific times to take beneficial actions; and Epidemic cards. Infection cards consist of one card for each city on the board and a color of the disease that will start there. At the start of the game, Infection cards are randomly drawn to populate the board with infections, from 1 to 3 cubes for a number of cities. Players start at Atlanta, the home of the Centers for Disease Control, and are given a random role and a number of Player cards. On each turn, a player can take 4 actions, consisting of any combination of the following:
        </p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Movement, as per the following four options:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Between interconnected cities (car and ferry travel)</li>
                    <li>To a city that the player holds that Player card of, discarding the Player card (direct flight)</li>
                    <li>To any city if the player is currently in one of the cities they hold the card of, discarding the Player card (charter flight)</li>
                    <li>From a city with a research lab to any city with a research lab, without discarding a city card (shuttle flight)</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Sharing information with another player, by being in the same city as that player and either giving or receiving the Player card representing that city</li>
            <li>Treating one unit of infection from a city that the player is presently in, removing a cube from that city</li>
            <li>Constructing a research lab in a city that the player holds the city card for (discarding that card afterwards)</li>
            <li>Finding the cure by being in a city with a research lab and holding five Player cards of the same color. Finding a cure does not stop further infection of that disease until all cubes of that color are removed from the board; from then on, drawing an Infection card of a color that is eradicated will result in no change to the board's state</li>
        </ol>
